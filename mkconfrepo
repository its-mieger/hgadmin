# The section names are names of repositories, or patterns matching
# multiple repositories.  Each section name must start with a "/".
# Names of repositories are interpreted relative to the directory
# where all managed repositories are placed. A pattern ends with
# exactly one or two '*' characters. If ending with only one '*', it
# will match all repositories located exactly in the directory pointed
# to by the rest of the pattern, without descending into
# subdirectories. If ending with two '*', it will match all
# repositories located in the directory or in any of its
# subdirectories.
#
# Directories or patterns names may not contain a ']' character. They
# may also not refer to hidden directories, files or repositories
# (whose name starts with a dot ('.')).
# 
# It is also not possible to use a '*' character anywhere in a
# repository name. A pattern may only contain exactly one or two '*'
# characters, which must be the last characters of the pattern.
#
# 
#
# The options in a section are interpreted as group names if they
# start with an '@' character (i.e. "@group1" refers to the group
# named "group1"), else as user names.  The option values may contain
# the characters "r", "w" and "C".  "r" denotes that the user has read
# access, "w" denotes that the user has read access and write access
# and "C" denotes that the user has read and write access and may
# create new repositories.
# 
# Examples:
#     [/**]
#     user1 = r
#     user2 = r w
#     user3 = rwC
#     @group1 = r
# 
# "/**" matches every repository.  user1, user2, user3 and every user
# in group1 therefore are allowed to read every
# repository. Additionally, user2 may write to every repository and
# user3 may write to every repository and create new repositories
# everywhere.
# 
#     [/**]
#     user1 = rw
#     user2 = rw 
#     [/sandbox/*]
#     user1 = rw
#     user3 = rw 
#     [/sandbox/foo]
#     user1 = rw
#     user4 = rw 
# 
# user1 may write everywhere. user2 may write everywhere except
# immediately below the "sandbox" - directory. user2 may however write
# to sandbox/dings/bums, if that repository exists.  user3 may write
# to every repository immediately below sandbox (p.ex. "sandbox/bar"
# or "sandbox/test", but neither to "sandbox" itself nor to
# "sandbox/foo". user4 may only write to "sandbox/foo".
# 
# The following section names are illegal:
# [invalid1]                       # does not start with '/'
# [/invalid2/*/reallyinvalid/**]   # contains a non-trailing '*'
# [/foo_$$]}&??/*]                 # contains a ']'

# This path refers to the directory where the repositories to manage
# are located.

# This path refers to the htpasswd file. If this repository contains a

# named "htpasswd".

# This path points to the hg-ssh script.
#
#   sshauthkeyspath = ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# This path refers to the authorized_keys file used by ssh to
# determine access authorization. This file will be replaced by an
# autogenerated list of allowed keys, restricted to only executing the
# "hg-ssh" command, as listed above.
